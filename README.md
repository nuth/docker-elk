# docker-elk
Docker-compose for setting up a elk-stack, with automatic logging from docker containers (stdin/stdout) and other log files in the container by configuring a /etc/logstash-forwarder.conf file in the container. Check out https://github.com/digital-wonderland/docker-logstash-forwarder for more information. (PS: does not work very well with aufs).

## JSON logging from your application
To make your logback logging java application log as json, check out https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder

## External logging setup
You can externally log to the ELK stack either using the logstash forwarder or using directly using a logtash tcp appender.

### Using the Logstash TCP appender
This approach is only viable on a Java application that uses logback.
Add this appender to the logback.xml configuration (note this is insecure):

---
```xml
<appender name="stash" class="net.logstash.logback.appender.LogstashTcpSocketAppender">
    <destination>10.243.200.51:8300</destination>

    <!-- encoder is required -->
    <encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder" />
</appender>

<!-- ... -->

<root level="INFO">
    <!-- other appenders you might have here -->
    <appender-ref ref="stash"/>
</root>
```
---

### Using the Logstash forwarder

For logging from external applications to the ELK-stack, 

1. setup logstash-forwarder (https://github.com/elastic/logstash-forwarder) on the nodes you want to log from to log to port 5043 on the machine with the elk stack.
2. Create a lumberjack.crt and lumberjack_ca.crt and key which you add to the logstash docker container through docker-logstash-forwarder.yml through the volume part(check docker-logstash-forwarder.yml and logstash.conf) and in the logstash-forwarder.conf on the logging machines.
3. Add a static field "parseas" to "json"  in order for the message part of your log files to be parsed as json in your logstash-forwarder.conf on the external nodes you want to log from. 

Example:
```

## Kibana
To log into kibana, go to 127.0.0.1:5601 on the machine you deployed your elk stack.

## Bugs/Readme
There are a few known bugs and the elasticsearch and kibana version are outdated.

I'm going to improve the documentation (this readme) when I get time. The goal is to make this a 5 second setup solution for proper log handling for all your applications/projects.
